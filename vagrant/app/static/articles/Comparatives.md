# Comparative Form

## Usage

We use comparative to note similarity or dissimilarity between two or more nouns according to adjectives.



## General Rule

To form the comparative, we append "ER" to the end of the adjective, like the following example:

- Small -> Smaller
- Tall -> Taller

### One Syllable adjectives

- When the adjective ends with "E", we just add "R" to the end of the word.

  Ex.:

  - Wide -> Wider
  - Nice -> Nicer

  

- When the adjective ends with Consonant + Vowel +  Consonant (CVC), we **normally** double the last letter.

  Ex.:

  - Big -> Bigger
  - Hot -> Hotter

###  Two Syllable adjectives ending in "Y"



To construct the comparative form, we remove the "Y" and add "IER" to the end of the adjective.

Ex.:

- Happy -> Happier
- Busy -> Busier

### Adjectives with two or more syllables (that doesn't end in "Y")

We use the therm "more" or "less" before the adjective we want to address.

Ex.:

- Beautiful -> More beautiful
- Admirable -> More Admirable

### Irregular Forms

- Good -> Better
- Bad -> Worse | Ill -> Worse
- Many/Much -> More
- Little -> Less
- Far -> Further/Farther
