## Rules



The general rule to form the *progressive tense* envolves just adding "ING" to the end of the verb, forming the *infinitive form* of the verb.



Ex.:

- To Study &rarr; Studying
- To Draw &rarr; Drawing
- To Paint &rarr; Painting
- To Go &rarr; Going
- To Cook &rarr; Cooking
- To Play &rarr; Playing

**But**, there are exceptions to this rule as explained below:



- Verb ending with "E"

  **Rule:** Remove "E" and add "ING".

  **Examples**: 

  - To Drive &rarr; Driving

  - To Live &rarr; Living

  - To Make &rarr; Making;

    

- Verb end with Consonant + Vowel + Consonant.

  **Rule:**  Double the final consonant and add "ING".

  **Examples**: 

  - To Stop &rarr; Stopping
  - To Sit &rarr; Sitting
  - To Swim &rarr; Swimming

  

- If there's **two-syllabe** verb that ends with CVC.

  **Rule:**  **Do not** double the final consonant, just add "ING".

  

  **Examples**: 

  - To happen &rarr; Happening

  - To Offer &rarr; Offering

    

- If the verb ends with "W", "X" or "Y" or the final Syllable is not emphatized.

  **Rule:**  **Do not** double the final consonant, just add "ING".

  **Examples**: 

  - To Fix &rarr; Fixing

  - To Enjoy &rarr; Enjoying

  - To Snow &rarr; Snowing

    

- If the verb ends with "IE"

  **Rule:**  Replace "IE" with "Y" and add "ING"

  **Examples**: 

  - To Die &rarr; Dying

    

- If the verb ends with CVC + the letter "L".

  **Rule:**  we **normally** double the final "L" before adding "ING";
